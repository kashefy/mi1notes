There are three learning paradigms in machine learning:
}
\begin{itemize}
\item Supervised learning\notesonly{. Learning with a teacher (cf. \sectionref{sec:supervised}).}
\item Unsupervised learning\notesonly{. Learning only from observations, without a teacher (cf. \sectionref{sec:unsupervised}).}
\item Reinforcement learning\notesonly{. This is about maximizing reward (cf. \sectionref{sec:reinforcement}).}
\item \textcolor{gray}{Evolutionary learning}\notesonly{. Not covered.}
\end{itemize}
\mode<article>{
It is possible to understand the differences between them by describing
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
    \item the data each of them deals with and
    \item the objective that each is trying to model
\end{inparaenum}
